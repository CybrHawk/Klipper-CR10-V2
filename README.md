# Files for my FDM 3D Printer : Creality CR10-V2.

## Important hardware informations :

I made some modifications to several hardware components, including some significant ones! The files are available as-is, and I bear no responsibility for any damages resulting from the use of this code with incompatible hardware.

Please thoroughly check the PIN configurations, especially! Also, be mindful of the modified extruder ratio. The bed leveling can easily be reverted for use with a BLTouch type probe; just uncomment the specified location in the printer.cfg file.

Here are the hardware details:

    Motherboard: BTT E3 SKR MINI V3.0
    Extruder: Biqu H2 V2S
    Bed leveling/accelerometer: Beacon3d RevH
    Filament Sensor: BTT Smart Filament Sensor V2.0

Feel free to explore my [Printables](https://www.printables.com/@Nowai) profile for specific files to adapt some of the hardware specified above for a CR10-V2.
